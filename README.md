# Generalized-One-shot-GAN-Adaption
## 1. Quick start
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1A6moUzSLh2vU4CckfnXESk4HwYC8NgMz?usp=sharing)

We provide a [inference demo on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1A6moUzSLh2vU4CckfnXESk4HwYC8NgMz?usp=sharing) to reproduce the qualitative results in paper.

## 2. Usage
-  Install StyleGAN dependency. Our project is based on the [Official PyTorch Implementation of StyleGAN](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan3), please first refer to its Requirements for creating the envs of stylegan.
-  Install CLIP.   Please refer to [CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP)
